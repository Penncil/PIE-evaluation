Prior Knowledge-Guided Integrated Likelihood Estimation (PIE)

# Description
Binary outcomes in electronic health records (EHR) derived using automated phenotype algorithms may suffer from phenotyping error, resulting in bias in association estimation. Huang et al. proposed the Prior Knowledge-Guided Integrated Likelihood Estimation (PIE) method to mitigate the estimation bias.
